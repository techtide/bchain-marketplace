# Marketplace

Marketplace is a decentralized application, running on the Ethereum blockchain, which aims to develop further trust and transparency between users of marketplace-like systems such as Craigslist and Gumtree.

Given the fact that decentralized often implies unmoderated, it may be more precise, for those that are more pedantic about the use of terminology, to call it somewhat of a hybrid-decentralized platform. My plan, as the developer of this project, is to have a Reddit-like approach on moderation.

In my mind, I envision the Marketplace DApp being seperated into different sub-markets, like Reddit's sub-reddit system. Perhaps, there would be a sub-market for books, clothes, vehicles, or any other goods. This system would be put in place to further moderate and stop illegal activity being conducted on the site. 

Furthermore, the plan is to have an authority which moderates listing solely on legalities, so as to ensure that the site remains completely legal, as it is meant to facilitate trust and transparency, and not crime.
